  	  <p>
  	    This guide will show how to build a fixture-driven set of test cases that mirror
  	    your SQL function migration dictionary (directory tree).
      </p>
      <p>
  	    How the test suite works is similar to how the migration itself functions: scan
  	    directories for SQL functions and then execute the SQL on the database.
      </p>
      <p>
  	    Your suite of tests is laid out in a mirror directory structure: each test is a
  	    directory with the same name as your SQL function file.  For example, if this is
  	    a migration in your set,
      </p>
  	  <p class="code">
  	    src/main/sql/functions/com/ni/project_a/subfeature1/function_x.sql
      </p>
      <p>and your test suite is rooted at</p>
      <p class="code">
        src/test/sql/functions
      </p>
      <p>then you will define a set of test cases for that function in a directory at:</p>
  	  <p class="code">
  	    src/test/sql/functions/com/ni/project_a/subfeature1/function_x/
  	  </p>
  	  <p>
  	    In that directory are test case subdirectories which are the actual tests on the
  	    function.  Within each test case lies these fixture files:
  	  </p>
  	  <ul class="code">
  	    <li>dataset.xml</li>
  	    <li>invoke.json</li>
		<li>expected-results.json</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2 id="test-case-intro">Test Cases and How They Operate</h2>
	  <p>
	    In each test case the set up phase establishes a set of data in the test database using
	    <span class="code">dataset.xml</span> as the definition of table rows; then,
	    your function is called with arguments defined in
	    <span class="code">invoke.json</span>; lastly, the result set of the function call
	    is asserted by matching it against <code class="code">expected-results.json</code>.
	  </p>

	  <h3 class="code-heading">dataset.xml</h3>
	  <p>
	    This file is a list of rows to insert into the test database.  The schema here is
	    identical to the DB itself: a row is defined as a XML element under &quot;dataset&quot;
	    with a name equal to the table (including schema as explained later).  The row's
	    columns are defined using XML attributes named the same as the column.  For example,
	  </p>
	  <p class="code">
	    &lt;public.dataview id=&quot;1&quot; native_dataview_id=&quot;7777&quot; name=&quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot; display_name=&quot;General Consumer&quot;/&gt;
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The test case will insert a row specifying only those 4 three columns into
	    &quot;dataview&quot;; moreover, all records in that table beforehand are deleted
	    as a clean-slate assurance to the test that only the records you specify are
	    present when your function is called.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    NOTE: Tables <b>not</b> referenced in your data set (or parent, common datasets mentioned
	    later) are unaffected.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    NOTE: You must specify the table's schema in XML element name even if it is public.
	  </p>

	  <h3 class="code-heading">invoke.json</h3>
	  <p>
	    A test case is unique in either a) how a function is called or b) the results that
	    appear based on the data in the database at the time.  Your test case specifies
	    the arguments to define this unique scenario in the system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Case in point: a function, <span class="code">get_dataview(...)</span>, will
        have two parameters to it: in a test case called &quot;main&quot; we'll define the
        arguments to pass in the tested call:
      </p>
	  <p class="code">
	    {
	      &quot;arguments&quot;: [ 1, &quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot; ]
	    }
      </p>
      <p>
        The invocation of the function is performed in JDBC using a <span class="code">CallableStatement</span>.
        Arguments are set using this class' <span class="code">setObject(argIndex, argValue)</span> methods.  The
        result is that the JDBC SQL progresses as such:
      </p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li>{call: get_dataview(?, ?)}</li>
        <li>{call: get_dataview(1, 'GENERAL_CONSUMER')}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But wait there's more!  If your SQL function file name differs from the actual function
        name or if your functions are not in the public schema, then the test case must specify
        how to call it:
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        {
          &quot;callAs&quot;: &quot;classification.getdataview&quot;
          &quot;arguments&quot;: [ 1, &quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot; ]
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        The test case will actuall invoke <span class="code">classification.getdataview</span> if it sees
        &quot;callAs&quot; in <span class="code">invoke.json</span>.  Alternatively, if your
        SQL function file name matches your SQL function name, then you can simply say,
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        {
          &quot;schema&quot;: &quot;classification&quot;
          &quot;arguments&quot;: [ 1, &quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot; ]
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result here <span class="code">classification.get_dataview</span> is called.
      </p>
      <h3 class="code-heading">expected-results.json</h3>
      <p>
        As a precursor, note that &quot;result set&quot; refers to the return value of the
        function as this is terminology used in JDBC.  More importantly, note that only 
        functions that return tables are supported at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to match up the function's output a JSON file is defined as an array of arrays.
        Each expected result set row is an inner array.  The expected columns are defined with
        primitive JSON values.  The order of the rows and the order of the columns in the JSON
        file is also expected to be the order of the actual result set.
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        [
          [ 1, 7777, "GENERAL_CONSUMER", "General Consumer" ]
        ]
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example only one row is expected in the result set; in the first row, we
        expected an Integer equal to 1 to be the first column, the second column to be an
        Integer equal to 7777, the third column a String equal to &quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot;,
        and lastly the fourth and final column a String equal to &quot;General Consumer&quot;
      </p>
      <p>An empty result set as you'd imagine is an empty JSON array.</p>
      <h2>Rolling It All Together</h2>
      <p>So the test case, &quot;main&quot;, will run the following data set:</p>
      <p class="code">
	    &lt;public.dataview id=&quot;1&quot; native_dataview_id=&quot;7777&quot; name=&quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot; display_name=&quot;General Consumer&quot;/&gt;
	  </p>
	  <p>to insert a dataview row into the test database; all other data views are deleted.</p>
	  <p>
	    Next, <span class="code">classification.get_dataview(1, &quot;GENERAL_CONSUMER&quot;)</span>
   	    is called which yields a result set that is matched to ...
   	  </p>
   	  <p class="code">
        [
          [ 1, 7777, "GENERAL_CONSUMER", "General Consumer" ]
        ]
      </p>

      <h2 id="test-context">Test Hierarchy Context</h2>
      <p>
        If you notice files above your test case or even test directories named <span class="code">common-*</span>
        then you are noticing contextual, parent fixture files that provide distributed, common
        test configuration.
      </p>

      <h3>common-dataset.xml</h3>
      <p>
        A suite of tests can have many test cases, so to reduce redundantly specifying a familiar, common
        set of table rows, the test suite directory tree can have base dataset files that
        concatenate with an individual test case's data set.
      </p>
      <p>Example: above the <span class="code">get_dataview</span> test case:</p>
      <p class="code">
         &lt;public.some_common_table_row col1=&quot;x&quot; col2=&quot;y&quot; col3=&quot;z&quot;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        All tests in directories at or below the directory containing this <span class="code">common-dataset.xml</span>
        will make a composite data set with this and their own.  This will result in a record in
        &quot;some_common_table_row&quot; and &quot;dataview&quot; for the test, <span class="code">get_dataview</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>common-invoke.json</h3>
      <p>
        Just with data sets, if you have common properties in your <span class="code">invoke.json</span>
        map files you can push them up into a distributed map file named <span class="code">common-invoke.json</span>.
        All tests underneath will merge the common properties with their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend the test cases for <span class="code">get_dataview(..)</span> only specify the
        arguments.  If you need to specify the table schema, make a <span class="code">common-invoke.json</span>
        file in the function's test directory that looks like
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        {
          &quot;schema&quot;: &quot;classification&quot;
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        The test case will use this config value just as if you specified that schema property
        in its <span class="code">invoke.json</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties are overridden similar to how methods and fields are overridden in programming
        objects: just as sub-classes override a method by specifying the same method as its parent
        class, if your invoke config specifies the same property as the common config, it overrides
        the value.
      </p>
      <p>So if you specify</p>
      <p class="code">
        {
          &quot;schema&quot;: &quot;public&quot;
        }
      </p>
      <p>
       in your test cases' <span class="code">invoke.json</span>, &quot;public&quot; will override
       &quot;classification&quot; as the effective property value for &quot;schema&quot;
      </p>

      <h2 id="test-run">The Test Process and Impact on Migrations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The test output will look like a JUnit report of unit tests.</li>
        <li>Each test case is named with its path relative to the base SQL function directory and appended the scenario name with ::</li>
        <li>SQL functions are migrated in a separate unit test database, and likewise, the unit tests run on that database</li>
        <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> the unit tests run before the real migrations; if at least one test fails, then the real migration are <b>NOT</b> run.</li>
